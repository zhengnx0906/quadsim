# 1.Overview

This navigation package provides the functions of robot simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and autonomous navigation.

Here some pictures in simulation

# 2. Source Code Structure

This source code include four directories

- **sensor_gazebo_plugin** contains some sensor gazebo_plugin

- **slam** contains some slam demos of some basic frameworks, such as radar-based gmapping, cartographer, as well as tests and configuration files for the current mainstream SLAM frameworks. Such as vision-based ORB-SLAM2, vision and IMU fusion ORB-SLAM3, radar, IMU and gps fusion LIO-SAM, radar, vision and IMU fusion LVI-SAM, etc.

- **navigation** Contains some demos for path planning and autonomous navigation.

# 3. Installation

## 3.1 Install gmapping

The gmapping package is already integrated with ros, you just need to run .

```
sudo apt install ros-${your_ros_version}-gmapping
```
If you want to know more,please visit https://wiki.ros.org/slam_gmapping 

We also should install the pointcloud_to_laserscan ros package to convert our 3D point cloud to 2D laser.
```
sudo apt install ros-${your_ros_version}-pointcloud_to_laserscan
```
## 3.2 Install catrographer
The cartographer_ros package is already integrated with ros, you just need to run .
```
sudo apt install ros-${your_ros_version}-cartographer-ros ros-${your_ros_version}-cartographer-rviz
```
But the version of ros-noetic  do not release, you should install it by source https://github.com/cartographer-project/cartographer

If you want to know more,please visit https://google-cartographer-ros.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ 

# 4. Run Demos
First, in one terminal, source the `setup.bash` to set up the environment

```
source ${your_workspace}/devel/setup.bash
```

Second, run the Gazebo simulator and load a robot.

```
roslaunch unitree_gazebo normal.launch rname:=a1 wname:=mini_maze use_xacro:=true use_lidar:=true
```

In this command, **rname** specifies the robot you use, **wname** specifies the gazebo_world you use, **use_xacro** means whether you use URDF or XACRO file, **use_lidar** means whether you use the sensor of lidar.

Third, in a new terminal, launch the slam demo. It will start the node of rviz and the demo_trot_keyboard, you can move the robot through the keyboard to build the map.

```
rosrun demo demo_slam_gmapping
```
Similarlyï¼Œyou also can launch.
```
rosrun demo demo_slam_cartographer
```
